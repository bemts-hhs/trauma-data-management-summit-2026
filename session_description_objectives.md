# Leveraging Underutilized Risk-Adjusted Metrics to Create Targeted Trauma PI Efforts

Trauma program leaders understand the importance of using risk-adjusted data to analyze patient outcomes. However, the weakness of most risk-adjusted benchmarking programs is that they do not use regression analysis to enable precise comparisons between subsets of the patient population. 

This presentation will help trauma program leaders and trauma data professionals take a fresh look at two metrics that are well known but underutilized in the world of injury care. Attendees will learn how these metrics leverage the power of true regression analysis to enable more precise comparisons between patient subsets — and how they yield more useful insights for developing effective performance improvement (PI) interventions.

The presenter will begin by examining the “predicted probability of survival” metric and explaining its underappreciated role in trauma data analysis. He will then walk through the methodology for using these predicted probabilities to compute the “W score,” a metric that adjusts for age, mechanism of injury and patient anatomy/physiology. 

The presenter will then explore multiple practical examples of calculating the W score for different subsets of the trauma population. The focus is on leveraging these metrics to compare performance within a single center or across a local system and using the results to plan and execute highly targeted PI efforts. 

After this session, attendees will be able to:

* Explain the benefits of using robust risk-adjusted metrics to analyze trauma patient cohorts
* Use common tools to compute both the predicted probability of survival and the W score 
* Identify ways to use these metrics to inform performance improvement efforts in trauma care
