# Presentation Outline: Leveraging Underutilized Risk-Adjusted Metrics to Create Targeted Trauma PI Efforts

## Introduction
- Briefly introduce yourself and your background as a data scientist and epidemiologist.
- Explain the importance of using risk-adjusted data to analyze patient outcomes in trauma care.
- Highlight the limitations of current risk-adjusted benchmarking programs that do not use regression analysis.

## Section 1: Understanding Risk-Adjusted Metrics
- Define risk-adjusted metrics and their significance in trauma data analysis.
- Introduce the two underutilized metrics: "predicted probability of survival" and the "W score".
- Explain why these metrics are important and how they can provide more precise comparisons between patient subsets.

## Section 2: Predicted Probability of Survival
- Explain the concept of the predicted probability of survival metric.
- Discuss its underappreciated role in trauma data analysis.
- Provide examples of how this metric can be used to analyze patient outcomes.

## Section 3: The W Score
- Introduce the W score and its methodology.
- Explain how the W score adjusts for age, mechanism of injury, and patient anatomy/physiology.
- Walk through the steps to compute the W score using common tools.

## Section 4: Practical Applications
- Provide multiple practical examples of calculating the W score for different subsets of the trauma population.
- Demonstrate how these metrics can be used to compare performance within a single center or across a local system.
- Highlight the benefits of using these metrics to plan and execute highly targeted performance improvement (PI) efforts.

## Section 5: Benefits of Robust Risk-Adjusted Metrics
- Summarize the benefits of using robust risk-adjusted metrics to analyze trauma patient cohorts.
- Emphasize the importance of moving beyond raw mortality rates to gain more useful insights.
- Discuss how these metrics can inform performance improvement efforts in trauma care.

## Conclusion
- Recap the key points discussed in the presentation.
- Encourage attendees to leverage these underutilized metrics in their own trauma data analysis.
- Invite questions and provide contact information for further discussion.

## Interactive Elements
- Include interactive elements such as polls or Q&A sessions to engage the audience.
- Provide handouts or digital resources with step-by-step instructions for computing the metrics.

## Final Thoughts
- Reinforce the importance of using advanced metrics to improve trauma care outcomes.
- Thank the audience for their attention and participation.
